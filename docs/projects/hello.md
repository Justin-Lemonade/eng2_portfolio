# Hello

#  Reflection on Building the Class Project Site  

##  Project Summary  
This was a class project where I built a simple website and threw it up on GitHub. At first, I had **no clue what I was doing**—picture a lost tourist with a backpack full of HTML—but somehow I made it work, one step (and error message) at a time.  

---

##  Challenges I Faced  
- Trial and error was basically my best friend.  
- Every “genius idea” I had turned into chaos on the screen.  
- Debugging felt like detective work where the culprit was always a missing semicolon.  
- Uploading to GitHub? Half the time I wondered if I was pushing code or just shouting into the void.  

---

## 📚 What I Learned  
- GitHub is actually useful (and not a mysterious black hole).  
- I can upload, manage, and keep track of files without too much drama.  
- Markdown is *magic* for formatting.  
- Lifesaver resource: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Reflection & Next Steps  
Perseverance is key. Sometimes you need to do “dumb” experiments, break stuff, and keep going until it finally works. Next time I want to:  
- Plan my site layout before diving in.  
- Write commit messages that actually make sense (no more `fix stuff`).  
- Learn version control commands so I do not spiral into panic.  
- Add cooler styling and features once I am braver with CSS.

## 😑 Conclusion  
This project taught me that tools like GitHub and Markdown are actually fun once you get them down. More importantly, it reminded me that *not giving up* turns frustration into small victor
