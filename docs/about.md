# About
My name is Justin Cassidy, and I am a Grade 12 student who is especially interested in software engineering and robotics. I am taking Engineering II because I enjoy technology, solving problems, and learning new things.

Outside of class, I run a local ultimate frisbee pickup group, which has taught me a lot about leadership and teamwork. I hope to keep building my skills in software and robotics as I prepare for future studies and projects.
